    Mayan EDMS is a wonderful product with a lot of features.
    However, its sheer number of features and capabilities can be a bit intimidating for the average user.
    This is where Open Paperless comes in. Open Paperless is a re-think
    of the user interface and user experience for Mayan EDMS.
    The goal is to reduce the complexity and make it more suitable for
    home users. Think of Open Paperless as a lightweight version of Mayan EDMS.
    一个用于扫描，索引和存档所有纸质文档的文件管理系统。可以OCR，预览，标签，签名，发送和接收文件。还有其工作流系统，基于角色的访问控制和REST API。
